# Brick factory

This project was one of my assigments for college, writing a software in C++ for simulating arbitrarily complicated logic networks.

The building blocks of the network are:
  - Logic nodes (And, Or, Not gate)
  - Sensor nodes (Color, Temperature, Contact)
  - Timer

The concept of the software was that you could build a network, see that visually in form of a flowchart, then simulate it and getting visual feedback on the object. Either it is a good product or a scrap.
What actually is built in this project is purly technical, as I was in a hurry at the very end, so there is no flowchart or any visual representation on the network.
I hope this helps whoever comes across this repo.
